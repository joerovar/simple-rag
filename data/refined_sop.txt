
TECHNIQUE 1: SPREAD OR CLOSE INTERVAL
Hold Back
When there has been a delay to service, and there is a long interval between trains, divide the length of the delay among as many trains as possible by holding back runs ahead of the delay.

Example:
A train with a three-minute interval is delayed three minutes:
1. Hold the first train one minute longer than schedule, giving that run a four-minute rather than a three-minute interval.
2. Hold the second train two minutes longer than schedule, giving that run a four minute rather than a three-minute interval.
3. Hold the third train three minutes longer than schedule, giving that run a four minute rather than a three-minute interval.
4. The delayed train now has a normal three-minute interval although still three minutes behind schedule.

Advantages:
- Restores scheduled service during relatively short delays; a simple and effective technique.
- Causes little inconvenience to customers.

Considerations:
- This technique can be used only when the delay is coming toward you.
- The spread interval should not exceed recovery time.
- The interval must not be spread so drastically that all trains will be overcrowded.
- The Transportation Manager, Rail Controller and other supervisors, both ahead of and behind the delay, must be notified when spreading the interval and when the normal schedule is resumed.
